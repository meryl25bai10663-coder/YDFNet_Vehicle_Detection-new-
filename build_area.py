"""Build a SUMO scenario for a real area, using OpenStreetMap streets.

Usage (from the project folder):
    python build_area.py --bbox WEST SOUTH EAST NORTH [--vph 1800]

Get the four numbers from openstreetmap.org: Export, then "Manually select a
different area". They are shown as left (west), bottom (south), right (east),
top (north).

Steps: download the streets (Overpass, through SUMO's osmGet.py, retrying
across several public mirrors if one is slow or overloaded), convert them to
a SUMO network (signals guessed from OSM tags), generate traffic with
randomTrips.py, and write areas/<id>/area.sumocfg. The dashboard can then use
that file like any other scenario.

Label for results: real streets, simulated traffic. The demand level (vehicles
per hour) is a setting you choose, or comes from an analyzed video.
