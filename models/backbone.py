"""
YOLOv10 backbone wrapper for YDFNet.

Loads a pretrained YOLOv10 detection model (via ultralytics) and strips off its
native PAN neck + v10Detect head, exposing only the raw multi-scale backbone
features (P3, P4, P5). These are the feature maps that BiFPN (models/bifpn.py)
and the DETR-style head (models/detr_head.py) consume instead.

Why bypass YOLOv10's own neck?
YOLOv10 already ships with its own FPN+PAN neck (layers 11-22) feeding into a
v10Detect head. YDFNet's whole point is to *replace* that neck+head combo with
BiFPN (better multi-scale fusion) + a DETR-style head (better occlusion
handling), so we only keep the backbone (layers 0-10) and discard the rest.

Layer indices below were determined empirically for yolov10n (see
inspect scripts / README) and correspond to:
    layer 4  -> P3, stride 8,  64 channels,  80x80 @ 640 input
    layer 6  -> P4, stride 16, 128 channels, 40x40 @ 640 input
    layer 10 -> P5, stride 32, 256 channels, 20x20 @ 640 input

If you swap to yolov10s/m/l/x, re-run utils/inspect_backbone.py to confirm
these indices and channel counts still hold (channel counts scale with model
size; layer indices should stay the same since the backbone topology doesn't
change across yolov10 variants).
