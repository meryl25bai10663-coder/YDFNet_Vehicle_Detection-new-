"""
DETR-style detection head for YDFNet.

Why a DETR head instead of YOLO's native anchor-based / anchor-free head:
YOLO-style heads predict boxes independently per grid cell/anchor, then rely
on NMS (non-max suppression) to remove duplicate detections. NMS is exactly
where dense, overlapping traffic scenes break down: two vehicles that are
genuinely close together (e.g. bumper-to-bumper at a red light) produce boxes
that NMS can't tell apart from duplicate detections of the *same* vehicle, so
one of them often gets incorrectly suppressed.

DETR reframes detection as direct *set prediction*: a fixed number of learned
"object queries" attend over the whole image (via a transformer decoder) and
each query predicts at most one object, with a bipartite (Hungarian) matching
loss during training that assigns each query to a distinct ground-truth
object. This removes NMS entirely and lets the model reason about all
detections jointly, which is what gives it an edge on occluded/overlapping
vehicles.

This implementation is a simplified single-scale DETR head: it takes BiFPN's
fused P4 map (a reasonable resolution/semantics tradeoff — P3 is large and
slow to attend over, P5 loses too much fine detail), flattens it into a
sequence of tokens, and decodes `num_queries` object predictions.
