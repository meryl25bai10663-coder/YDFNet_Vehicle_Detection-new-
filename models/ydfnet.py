"""
YDFNet: YOLOv10 backbone + BiFPN neck + DETR-style head.

End-to-end assembly of the three pieces built in backbone.py, bifpn.py, and
detr_head.py. This mirrors the architecture described in the research paper
your team is using to justify the Vehicle Detection module:

    Image -> YOLOv10 backbone (P3/P4/P5) -> BiFPN (multi-scale fusion)
          -> DETR head (set prediction, no NMS) -> class + bbox predictions

Design choice: the DETR head in this prototype attends over the BiFPN P4
scale only (stride 16, e.g. 40x40 tokens @ 640 input = 1600 tokens). This is
a deliberate simplification — a full multi-scale deformable-attention DETR
(as in Deformable DETR) would attend over P3+P4+P5 jointly for better small
object recall, at higher compute cost. Attending over P3 alone would be very
expensive (80x80 = 6400 tokens, transformer self-attention is O(n^2)) and
attending over P5 alone loses too much spatial detail for small/distant
vehicles. P4 is the standard tradeoff point in DETR-style detectors. See
README "Known Limitations" for how to extend this to full multi-scale
attention if your team wants a closer match to the paper.
