"""
EmergeRoute - Rule-Based Policy Generator

Given the current traffic state (from the simulation/sensors), proposes
multiple candidate traffic-control actions to test. This matches the brief's
requirement: "a rule-based policy generator that proposes multiple candidate
traffic actions (signal timing changes, diversions, heavy-vehicle
restrictions, emergency corridors)".

Deliberately rule-based, not learned -- this is faster to build, fully
explainable (important for the dashboard's "why was this chosen"
requirement), and matches exactly what the brief asks for. No ML needed here;
the ML/optimization happens downstream in the scoring engine (NSGA-II).
