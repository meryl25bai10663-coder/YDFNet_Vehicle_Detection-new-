"""
EmergeRoute — Simulation Layer

Runs the SUMO simulation with a given traffic-light policy applied via TraCI
(SUMO's real-time control API), and returns the resulting metrics. This is
the core function the Policy Generator + Scoring Engine (pymoo/NSGA-II) call
for every candidate policy they want to test.

A "policy" here is a dict describing signal timing changes to apply at one
or more intersections -- e.g. extending green time on a congested approach.
This matches the brief's "signal timing changes" candidate-action type;
diversions / heavy-vehicle restrictions / emergency corridors follow the
same pattern (modify routing/restrictions via TraCI instead of signal timing)
and can be added as additional policy "types" using this same harness.

Usage (standalone test):
    python run_policy.py
